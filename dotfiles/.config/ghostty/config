# Missing from Ghostty (that I have in kitty):
# - `url_prefixes` -> can't set custom prefixes (maybe `link:` is the way to do this?)
# - `window_alert_on_bell` -> `echo -n '\a'` doesn't seem to do anything in Ghostty
# - `confirm_os_window_close` -> if you restart the computer Ghostty just loses your work
# - `tab_activity_symbol` -> no activity indicator
# - `active_border_color` / inactive_border_color: can't get visible borders (they seem to be black on all the black screens, vs the defaults in kitty)
# - Inline comments in this file?
# - ⌘-9 to go to "last tab" not "9th tab" (as in Safari)
# - Remappings:
#   - Open scrollback in less: `scrollback_pager env LESS= less --tabs=4 --ignore-case --RAW-CONTROL-CHARS --quit-if-one-screen --LONG-PROMPT --window=-4 --jump-target=1 --pattern=^❯ +INPUT_LINE_NUMBER`
#   - Open scrollback in nvim

# Nice in Ghostty:
# - Native emoji entry with ⌘-⌃-Space
