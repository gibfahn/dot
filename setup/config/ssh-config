# ssh (or my alias `s`) accepts a bunch of cool options:
# - Use a different ssh key: s -i ~/.ssh/alternative_id_rsa host
# - Use a different username: s gib@host
# - Don't use ssh key (force password): s gib:@host
# However if you don't want to specify them every time, set them in here.
# See `man ssh_config` for more information.

# You can define multiple hosts on one line.
# The Host is the shortcut (`s host1` or `s c` to ssh in).
# The Hostname is something you can ping (DNSable hostname or IP address).
#   %h is what you typed in `Host`.
# Other fields are optional.
# User is your account on that machine.
# Port defaults to 22 (ssh port).
